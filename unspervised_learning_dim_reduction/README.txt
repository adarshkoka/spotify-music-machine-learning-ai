The file should be accessible by anyone with a Georgia Tech account.


Instructions to Run Code:

Download akoka7_unsupervised_learning.zip and extract the zip file. 
Open the folder and open the next folder and then run "run_this.py" using a Python compiler.
The terminal will prompt you asking to choose a dataset (1 or 2). Dataset 1 is the Hit/Flops dataset and Dataset 2 is the My Liked Songs dataset.
After you input a number the code will run each algorithm in order and display graphs.

I commented/uncommented the code at the bottom of "run_this.py" to pick which algorithms I wanted to run.
Regular packages used except I also used seaborn for some of the graphs.

Directories:

datasets folder contains Dataset 1 (hit/flop) and 2 (liked songs) mentioned in the report.
