The file should be accessible by anyone with a Georgia Tech account, if not please email me at akoka7@gatech.edu and I can provide access by email.


Instructions to Run Code:

Download akoka7_supervised_learning.zip and extract the zip file. 
Open the folder and run "run_this.py" using a Python compiler.
The terminal will prompt you asking to choose a dataset (1 or 2). Dataset 1 is the Hit/Flops dataset and Dataset 2 is the My Liked Songs dataset.
After you input a number the code will run each algorithm in order and display graphs. Graphs will not show for all algorithms to reduce runtime (only decision tree and k neighbors).
If you want to see the graphs for Boosting, neural network, or SVM you will need to go into each corresponding file (boosting.py, etc.) and uncomment the code there.
You will need to close each graph after it is displayed in order for the program to continue running.
Only standard Python libraries were used such as pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, etc. so should not need to download anything.


Directories:

Graphs folder contains all graphs and decision trees presented in the report
datasets folder contains Dataset 1 and 2 mentioned in the report along with datasets for extra decades. 
The decade can be changed in "algorithm-manager.py" by changing the decade number on line 16. Defualt is 2010s same as the report.
